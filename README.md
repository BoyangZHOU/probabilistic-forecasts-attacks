# Attack-Probabilistic-Models

This is the source code for [Adversarial Attacks on Probabilistic Autoregressive Forecasting Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03778.pdf). 

This repository contains two sets of experiments, one for the 
[UCI electricity dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014#),
and one on historical S&P500 stock prices. 

In both the **Electricity** and **Finance** folders, 
you will find another **README** file describing how to run the experiments.
